## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was built using a web API. The button triggers a click event to fetch data from the API, and the data (in this case, a random fact) is placed in the DOM. Every click retrieves a new fact!

## Optimizations

This is a really simple site that could be optimized in many ways. One example would be to make this work in a different environment or using a framework. 

## Lessons Learned:

This project gave me practice testing APIs and allowed me to play with how you can retrieve and present data.
